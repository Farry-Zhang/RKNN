# RKNN
Its our attempt to use RKNN in radar target tracking algorithm
RKNN is a combination between RNN and Kalman filter. For Kalman filter, its widely used in radar target tracking. And we try to use RNN to update the parameters of Kalman filter. 
We got some achievements, but its still in the trial stage. 

There are MATLAB version and Python version.
